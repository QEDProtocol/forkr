# Forkr
An easy to use tool for simulating forks/re-orgs on Bitcoin and Dogecoin


## Why is the useful
For ordinals and other inscription based applications where sequence of inscriptions matter, it is crucial that indexers are able to handle forks in the Bitcoin/Dogecoin blockchains (millions of dollars are on the line).

### If you don't handle forks/re-orgs correctly, people will end up with incorrect balances and double spends.

## Getting Started
First you will want to install `docker` and `npm`, then start either a BitIDE Bitcoin or BitIDE Dogecoin docker container:

### Bitcoin
```bash
docker run -p 1337:1337 -it --rm qedprotocol/bitide:latest
```

### Dogecoin
```bash
docker run -p 1337:1337 -it --rm qedprotocol/bitide-doge:latest
```

The docker container will start the following services:
- A Bitcoin/Dogecoin Regtest node ready for development
- A Bitcoin/Dogecoin RPC API running at http://devnet:devnet@127.0.0.1:1337/bitcoin-rpc/
- A Block Explorer running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/explorer/
- An Electrs full history API running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/api/

Next run:
```bash
docker ps
```

And you should see something like:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                         COMMAND                  
a9fa22996770   qedprotocol/bitide:latest     "bash /app/start.sh"
```
The 12 hexadecimal characters at the start (in this case, "a9fa22996770") is your **container id**


To start Forkr, just run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QEDProtocol/forkr
cd forkr
npm install
npm run start [YOUR_CONTAINER_ID]
```

So in the case of the previous example I would run:
```bash
npm run start a9fa22996770
```


## Using Forkr

At startup, Forkr creates a fork of the current chain called `default`.
To create a a resumable copy of a chain at a given point, send an HTTP get request to:
```text
curl http://localhost:1449/createfork/<name of your new fork>?source=<source of the fork>&activate=<1 or 0, depending on if you want to activate it>
````

To activate a forked chain, send an HTTP get request to:
```bash
curl http://localhost:1449/activatefork/<name of the fork you want to activate>
```

To view thes status of Forkr, send an HTTP get request to:
```bash
curl https://localhost:1449/status
```

## Tutorial

### Creating our first forks
Let's create two forks of the default chain, **fork1** and **fork2**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/createfork/fork1?source=default&activate=1"
```
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/createfork/fork2?source=default&activate=1"
```

Next, let's check the status of forker by running:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/status"
```
We should see something like the following:
```json
{"forks":["default","fork1","fork2"],"currentFork":"fork2","isBusy":false,"rpcIsDisabled":false,"rpcIsRunning":true}
```
As we can see ```currentFork``` is ```fork2```, lets switch back to **fork1**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/activatefork/fork1"
```

<br />
<br />

### Generating divergent blocks on fork1 and fork2
Now that we are on fork1, we can make some transactions using the RPC endpoint http://devnet:devnet@127.0.0.1:1337/bitcoin-rpc/, and we can check them out in the block explorer at http://localhost:1337/explorer/.

These transactions can be ordinal inscriptions/other transactions relevant to your indexer.


Once we've made some transactions, we can switch over to `fork2` by running:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/activatefork/fork2"
```

If we now refresh the block explorer, the new transactions we have made will not be there (fork2 will currently be back at the tip of the `default` fork).

We can now make some transactions on fork2 (Again, these transactions should be ordinal inscriptions/other transactions relevant to your indexer). 
For the best simulation of real forking activity, lets mine more blocks than we did on fork1 so it has a higher block height.


<br />
<br />


### Testing your indexer
Let's switch back to fork1 now:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/activatefork/fork1"
```

Now, you can startup your indexer and index based on fork1 (use jsonrpc-import for txindex based indexers/other RPC-compatible indexers).


In a re-org/fork, an active chain state is superseceded by a longer chain of valid blocks which does not include previously confirmed/indexed blocks.

Since fork2 has a longer chain of valid blocks that don't include some of fork1's transactions, let's test our indexer's ability to handle a re-org by switching to fork2:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:1449/activatefork/fork2"
```

Now check your indexer and see if it handled the re-org correctly =) üéâ
